    %h2 Standard Set of APIs on Collection

    %p
      Most resource collections provides the following set of APIs.

    %ul
      %li Retrieving the collection (Index)
      %li Creating or updating items (POST)
      %li <strong>Optional</strong>: Retrieving one item (GET)
    
    %h2 Standard Index Parameters
    
    %p
      Indexing actions take a set of parameters; <code>since</code>, <code>until</code>, and <code>glb</code>.
      They are used to limit the size of the result sets.

    %table
      %tr
        %th <code>since</code>
        %td Limits the result set to contain only updated items since the parameter.
      %tr
        %th <code>until</code>
        %td Limits the result set to reject items updated since the parameter.
      %tr
        %th <code>glb</code>
        %td Greatest lower bound of id of the result set. This is used to retrieve next batch of the collection.
    
    %p The result set can be described as follows:

    %blockquote { item | since ≤ item.updated_at ⋀ item.updated_at < until ⋀ glb < item.id }

    %p The items are sorted by their <code>id</code>s.

    %p The result will be on following pattern.

    %pre
      = preserve do
        :escaped
          {
            "timestamp": $Timestamp,
            "next-url": $URL,
            "last-updated-at": $Timestamp,
            $rows: [ $objects ],
          }

    %dl
      %dt timestamp
      %dd
        :markdown
          The server time.
          This is sent for the case client local clock is incorrect.
          If `until` parameter is specified, `timestamp` will be the requested `until`.
      %dt next-url (optional)
      %dd
        The URL to retrieve next result set.
        This will be unspecified in the case there are no more results.
      %dt last-updated-at
      %dd
        The timestamp on the time, there were last update of an object which belongs to the resource you requested.
      %dt $rows
      %dd
        :markdown
          Array of objects.
          The name will be different, `items` for MenuItems, `categories` for Categories, and `checkouts` for Checkouts.

    %h3 Fetching Whole Collection

    :markdown
      There are limitation on the number of objects contained in one request; this is the reason we accept `glb` parameter.
      You might have a question that how to get the whole collection?
      A set of requests to fetch collections can be interleaved by requests which updates objects which is contained in the collection.
      In that case, the `updated_at` field will be updated and because of the `until` parameter included in the fetch request, the updated objects can not be fetched.

    :markdown
      `last-updated-at` field is to handle such case.
      If there are no `next-url` field sent, which means there are no more object for the parameters you specified, check if the `timestamp` field is newer than `last-updated-at`.

    :markdown
      1. Send a request without `until` and `glb` parameters.
      2. Check if the response contains `next-url` field.
      3. If contains, fetch the `next-url` and go step 2 again.
      4. If not caintains, send a request again but with `since` = `timestamp`, and got step 2 again.

    %h2 POST Convention

    %p
      POST actions to collection create or update more than one items.
      This helps to make updating many items faster.

    %p
      The request will be like the following:

    %pre
      = preserve do
        :escaped
          [
            { "name": "new object", ... },
            { "name": "another new object", ...},
            { "id": 123, "name": "object to be updated" },
          ]
    
    :markdown
      * If there are no `id` field in an object, it will create new item.
      * If there are `id` field in an object, it will update an existing item.

    :markdown
      The post action is transactional.
      If there are an error processing an item, all creation or update of items will be canceled.
      There will be one of *everything ok* or *nothing changed*.

    :markdown
      There is no limitation on number of objects in one request, but you should take care of it.
      100 items in a request will be ok. 10,000 items in a request should cause a problem.
      We will ask you to stop posting too big request, if there are some problem.

      
  .tab-pane#objects
    :markdown
      Every object has `created_at` and `updated_at` fields.
