          <h1>Authentication</h1>
          <p>
            Currently we provide very simple token based authentication mechanism.
            Every installations of client have their own secret tokens which can be used for API access.
          </p>
          <h2>Installation</h2>
          <p>
            A user will <it>install</it> apps to ubiregi.com.
            Installations generate new secret tokens.
            The user have to notify an app its secret token, and the app will be authenticated with the token.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>User need to <it>install</it> an app to use it</li>
            <li>Each installation have their own secret token</li>
            <li>
              There are no automated way to notify app its secret token
              <br />
              (We are planning to provide standardized mechanisms such as OAuth.)
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            User may <it>uninstall</it> an app.
            Un-installation of an app will invalidate the secret token.
            After your app got uninstalled by the user, your app can not access the user's data.
          </p>
          <p>
            The secret token is installation specific.
            If your user uninstall your application, the token will be invalidated.
            After your user re-install your application, new token will be generated.
          </p>
          <p>
            To install your app, visit your app's install URL.
          </p>
          <img src="images/app_installation.png" width="100%">
          <p>
            You can install/uninstall the app to your account.
            Visit <a href='https://ubiregi.com/installs'>https://ubiregi.com/installs</a> to list all applications you have installed.
          </p>
          <h2>Authorization</h2>
          <p>
            There is only one authorizatioin levels, <strong>everything</strong>.
            If a user allows an app to access its data (installs the app), the app can access everything.
          </p>
          <h1>The protocol</h1>
          <p>
            Give HTTP the following two request headers on all requests.
          </p>
          <table>
            <tr>
              <th width='190'><code>X-Ubiregi-Auth-Token</code></th>
              <td>
                Users secret token to identify user and installation.
                This is used for authentication.
                Both of you and users are responsible to keep it secret.
              </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <th><code>X-Ubiregi-App-Secret</code></th>
              <td>
                To identify your app.
                This can be used to block the app.
                You are responsible to keep it secret.
              </td>
            </tr>
          </table>
          <p>
            If <code>X-Ubiregi-Auth-Token</code> is invalid, your request will result in <code>401</code> (Unauthorized) status.
          </p>
          <p>
            Note that there are another possibility to make your request failed.
            <code>402</code> (Payment required) may be returned in the case the user's subscription got expired.
            After the user renew the subscription, the status will be recovered.
          </p>
          <p>
            Check the <a href='ubiregi-api-client-example.rb'>example app</a> to see how the authentication is exactly.
